# Create a vector m of integers that starts at 32 and ends at 99.

seq(7, 49, 7) 

# But note that the second argument does not need to be the last number
# It simply determines the maximum value permitted
# so the following line of code produces the same vector as seq(7, 49, 7)
seq(7, 50, 7)

# Create a sequence of numbers from 6 to 55, with 4/7 increments and determine its length
length(seq(6, 55, 4/7))

# Confirm the class of 1L is integer

# Define the vector x
